# connect-four
This is the base python code for a Connect Four game. It's a mini-assignment, where you need to implement both your own board and your own AI to beat the existing AI players.

I've already implemented the code that creates the board and draws it to the screen. I also added a ranking system so you can see how your AI compares to the existing (bad) AIs I created.

# Install the dependencies

This depends on a small number of third-party libraries, which are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). These are formatted so they work with Python's `pip` tool, so you can install them by running `python3 -m pip -r requirements.txt`.
